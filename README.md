# ODSC Hackathon 🎮

## Project Description 🌐

Cutting-edge multimedia platform that combines the power of 3D artwork generation, music composition, and intelligent search capabilities. Users are able to seamlessly generate 3D artwork and music, while the system provides intelligent filtering and search functionalities for text-to-image, text-to-audio, and even image-to-text queries. All data is stored and made searchable using the Weaviate database, ensuring efficient searchability, content generation, and seamless minting of the created assets. This project aims to offer a comprehensive solution for content creation, exploration, and monetization, bridging the worlds of visual arts and music with advanced AI-powered search and generation features..
